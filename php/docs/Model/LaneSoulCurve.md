# LaneSoulCurve

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**assigned_lane** | **int** | The lane the matchup was played in, or &#x60;0&#x60; when &#x60;assigned_lane&#x60; was grouped away. See the &#x60;lane_info&#x60; array of &lt;https://api.deadlock-api.com/v1/assets/generic-data&gt;. |
**enemy_hero_ids** | **int[]** | The ascending hero id pair they laned against, or empty when grouped away. |
**hero_ids** | **int[]** | The ascending hero id pair that shared the lane, or empty when grouped away. See more: &lt;https://api.deadlock-api.com/v1/assets/heroes&gt; |
**matches_played** | **int** | Lane matchups behind the row, counted at its *first* sample. This is what &#x60;min_matches&#x60; and &#x60;max_matches&#x60; filter on, so it does not move when the requested time range changes; read &#x60;sample_matches&#x60; for what any individual point rests on. |
**net_worth_diff** | **float[]** | Mean souls the duo is ahead by at the matching entry of &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. Negative means behind. Same length as &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. |
**net_worth_diff_std** | **float[]** | Population standard deviation of the lead across the counted matchups, at the matching entry of &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. Same length as &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;.  Spread between individual games, not uncertainty about the mean: it stays wide however many matchups are counted, because lane outcomes genuinely differ that much. |
**sample_matches** | **int[]** | How many lane matchups were still running at the matching entry of &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. Falls off towards the end of the curve as shorter matches drop out. |
**sample_times_s** | **int[]** | Seconds into the match each entry of the curves was sampled at, ascending. |
**stats** | [**array<string,\OpenAPI\Client\Model\LaneStatCurve>**](LaneStatCurve.md) | A curve per stat named in &#x60;stats&#x60;. Empty unless the parameter was set. |
