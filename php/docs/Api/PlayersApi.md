## `matchHistory()`

```php

Match History

This endpoint returns the player match history for the given `account_id`.  If the account is friends with one of our bots, the match history is a combination of the data from **Steam** and **ClickHouse**, so you always get the most up-to-date data and full history. If the account is not friends with a bot, only the stored match history from **ClickHouse** is returned.

## `rank()`

```php
rank($account_id): \OpenAPI\Client\Model\RankResponse
```

Rank

Returns the player's rank at the end of their latest ranked match, i.e. the rank they entered that match with plus the progress the match awarded. A subrank spans 1000 progress points, so a single match can move the badge. Eternus subranks are instead percentile cuts Valve recomputes daily, so within Eternus the badge is the one the player entered the match with.  Only ranked matches carry a rank, and it stays unset while the player is in placement games. When none of the player's recent ranked matches reports a rank, `badge`, `rank` and `subrank` are all `0`, which is the `Obscurus` (unranked) tier, and `last_match` is `null`.  `last_match` carries the rank metadata Valve reported on that match, e.g. rank progress, remaining placement games and demotion protection.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');



$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Api\PlayersApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client()
);
$account_id = 56; // int | The players `SteamID3`

## `rankAvgImage()`

```php
rankAvgImage($account_ids, $format): int[]
```

Rank Avg Image

Returns the average rank badge image (binary) for a comma-separated list of account IDs. Accounts without a rank are left out of the average; if none of them has one, the `Obscurus` image is returned. Use `?format=webp` for WebP.

### Example

<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');



$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Api\PlayersApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.

    new GuzzleHttp\Client()
);
$account_ids = array(56); // int[] | Comma-separated list of account IDs (max 12).
$format = 'format_example'; // string | Image format. Defaults to `png`. Supported: `png`, `webp`.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->rankAvgImage($account_ids, $format);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling PlayersApi->rankAvgImage: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;

```

### Parameters

## `rankImage()`

```php
rankImage($account_id, $format): int[]
```

Rank Image

Returns the rank badge image directly (binary), not a URL, with the player's I-VI division numeral drawn on it. Players whose recent ranked matches carry no rank, and players still in placement, get the plain tier badge. Use `?format=webp` for WebP.

### Example
