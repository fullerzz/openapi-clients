## `bulkMetadata()`

```php
bulkMetadata($include_info, $include_more_info, $include_objectives, $include_mid_boss, $include_player_info, $include_player_kda, $include_player_items, $include_player_stats, $include_player_final_stats, $include_player_death_details, $include_player_custom_user_stats, $game_mode, $match_mode, $match_ids, $min_unix_timestamp, $max_unix_timestamp, $min_duration_s, $max_duration_s, $min_average_badge, $max_average_badge, $min_match_id, $max_match_id, $is_high_skill_range_parties, $is_low_pri_pool, $is_new_player_pool, $account_ids, $hero_ids, $item_filter_hero_id, $include_item_ids, $exclude_item_ids, $extra_match_columns, $extra_player_columns, $order_by, $order_direction, $limit, $format): int[]
```

Bulk Metadata

This endpoints lets you fetch multiple match metadata at once. The response is a JSON array of match metadata.  When player info is included, each player object contains `hero_build_id` and `pregame_hero_id` fields (if available) from demo analysis.  > **Note:** The `hero_build_id` represents the first build the player had selected when the game started. It does not reflect any build changes made during the match.  > **Note:** The `pregame_hero_id` is the hero the player had locked before the pre-game swap window (`null` if unknown). A player swapped heroes when it differs from their `hero_id`.  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 10req/min | | Key | 10req/10s | | Global | 100req/min |

## `ingestUrls()`

```php
ingestUrls($ingest_live_url)
```

Ingest Live Broadcast URLs

Submit one or more live broadcast URLs so they show up in the `GET /live/urls` listing.  Each submitted URL is stored for 15 minutes; re-submit periodically to keep a match listed while it is still live. Existing entries for the same `match_id` are overwritten.  These URLs can be used in any demofile broadcast parser: - [Demofile-Net](https://github.com/saul/demofile-net) - [Haste](https://github.com/blukai/haste/)  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 100req/s | | Key | - | | Global | - |

## `metadata()`

```php
metadata($match_id, $is_custom, $disable_steam)
```

Metadata

This endpoint returns the match metadata for the given `match_id` parsed into JSON.  Each player object is enriched with a `hero_build_id` field (if available) from demo analysis.  > **Note:** The `hero_build_id` represents the first build the player had selected when the game started. It does not reflect any build changes made during the match.  `pregame_hero_ids` maps `account_id` to the hero the player had locked before the pre-game swap window (if available from demo analysis). A player swapped heroes when it differs from their `hero_id`.

Salts

This endpoints returns salts that can be used to fetch metadata and demofile for a match.  **Note:** We currently fetch many matches without salts, so for these matches we do not have salts stored.  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | From DB: 100req/s<br>From Steam: 10req/30mins | | Key | From DB: -<br>From Steam: 10req/min | | Global | From DB: -<br>From Steam: 10req/10s |

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');



$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Api\MatchesApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client()
);
$match_id = 56; // int | The match ID
$disable_steam = True; // bool | If `true`, skip the Steam fallback when the salts are not available in Clickhouse and return an error instead.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->salts($match_id, $disable_steam);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling MatchesApi->salts: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
