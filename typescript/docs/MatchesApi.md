# **bulkMetadata**
> Array<number> bulkMetadata()

 This endpoints lets you fetch multiple match metadata at once. The response is a JSON array of match metadata.  When player info is included, each player object contains `hero_build_id` and `pregame_hero_id` fields (if available) from demo analysis.  > **Note:** The `hero_build_id` represents the first build the player had selected when the game started. It does not reflect any build changes made during the match.  > **Note:** The `pregame_hero_id` is the hero the player had locked before the pre-game swap window (`null` if unknown). A player swapped heroes when it differs from their `hero_id`.  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 10req/min | | Key | 10req/10s | | Global | 100req/min |

 Submit one or more live broadcast URLs so they show up in the `GET /live/urls` listing.  Each submitted URL is stored for 15 minutes; re-submit periodically to keep a match listed while it is still live. Existing entries for the same `match_id` are overwritten.

# **metadata**

 This endpoint returns the match metadata for the given `match_id` parsed into JSON.  Each player object is enriched with a `hero_build_id` field (if available) from demo analysis.  > **Note:** The `hero_build_id` represents the first build the player had selected when the game started. It does not reflect any build changes made during the match.  `pregame_hero_ids` maps `account_id` to the hero the player had locked before the pre-game swap window (if available from demo analysis). A player swapped heroes when it differs from their `hero_id`.

# **salts**
> MatchSaltsResponse salts()

 This endpoints returns salts that can be used to fetch metadata and demofile for a match.  **Note:** We currently fetch many matches without salts, so for these matches we do not have salts stored.  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | From DB: 100req/s<br>From Steam: 10req/30mins | | Key | From DB: -<br>From Steam: 10req/min | | Global | From DB: -<br>From Steam: 10req/10s |     

### Example

```typescript
import {
    MatchesApi,
    Configuration
} from 'deadlock_api_client';

const configuration = new Configuration();
const apiInstance = new MatchesApi(configuration);

let matchId: number; //The match ID (default to undefined)
let disableSteam: boolean; //If `true`, skip the Steam fallback when the salts are not available in Clickhouse and return an error instead. (optional) (default to undefined)

const { status, data } = await apiInstance.salts(
    matchId,
    disableSteam
);
