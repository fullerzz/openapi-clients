Bulk Metadata


This endpoints lets you fetch multiple match metadata at once. The response is a JSON array of match metadata.

When player info is included, each player object contains `hero_build_id` and `pregame_hero_id` fields (if available) from demo analysis.

> **Note:** The `hero_build_id` represents the first build the player had selected when the game started. It does not reflect any build changes made during the match.

> **Note:** The `pregame_hero_id` is the hero the player had locked before the pre-game swap window (`null` if unknown). A player swapped heroes when it differs from their `hero_id`.

# **ingest_urls**

Ingest Live Broadcast URLs


Submit one or more live broadcast URLs so they show up in the `GET /live/urls` listing.

Each submitted URL is stored for 15 minutes; re-submit periodically to keep a match listed
while it is still live. Existing entries for the same `match_id` are overwritten.

These URLs can be used in any demofile broadcast parser:
- [Demofile-Net](https://github.com/saul/demofile-net)
- [Haste](https://github.com/blukai/haste/)

# **metadata**

Metadata


This endpoint returns the match metadata for the given `match_id` parsed into JSON.

Each player object is enriched with a `hero_build_id` field (if available) from demo analysis.

> **Note:** The `hero_build_id` represents the first build the player had selected when the game started. It does not reflect any build changes made during the match.

`pregame_hero_ids` maps `account_id` to the hero the player had locked before the pre-game swap window (if available from demo analysis). A player swapped heroes when it differs from their `hero_id`.

# **metadata_raw**
> List[int] metadata_raw(match_id, is_custom=is_custom, disable_steam=disable_steam)

Metadata as Protobuf


This endpoints returns the raw .meta.bz2 file for the given `match_id`.

You have to decompress it and decode the protobuf message.

Protobuf definitions can be found here: [https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs)

Relevant Protobuf Messages:
- CMsgMatchMetaData
- CMsgMatchMetaDataContents
