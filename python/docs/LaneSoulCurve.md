## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**assigned_lane** | **int** | The lane the matchup was played in, or &#x60;0&#x60; when &#x60;assigned_lane&#x60; was grouped away. See the &#x60;lane_info&#x60; array of &lt;https://api.deadlock-api.com/v1/assets/generic-data&gt;. | 
**enemy_hero_ids** | **List[int]** | The ascending hero id pair they laned against, or empty when grouped away. | 
**hero_ids** | **List[int]** | The ascending hero id pair that shared the lane, or empty when grouped away. See more: &lt;https://api.deadlock-api.com/v1/assets/heroes&gt; | 
**matches_played** | **int** | Lane matchups behind the row, counted at its *first* sample. This is what &#x60;min_matches&#x60; and &#x60;max_matches&#x60; filter on, so it does not move when the requested time range changes; read &#x60;sample_matches&#x60; for what any individual point rests on. | 
**net_worth_diff** | **List[float]** | Mean souls the duo is ahead by at the matching entry of &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. Negative means behind. Same length as &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. | 
**net_worth_diff_std** | **List[float]** | Population standard deviation of the lead across the counted matchups, at the matching entry of &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. Same length as &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;.  Spread between individual games, not uncertainty about the mean: it stays wide however many matchups are counted, because lane outcomes genuinely differ that much. | 
**sample_matches** | **List[int]** | How many lane matchups were still running at the matching entry of &#x60;sample_times_s&#x60;. Falls off towards the end of the curve as shorter matches drop out. | 
**sample_times_s** | **List[int]** | Seconds into the match each entry of the curves was sampled at, ascending. | 
**stats** | [**Dict[str, LaneStatCurve]**](LaneStatCurve.md) | A curve per stat named in &#x60;stats&#x60;. Empty unless the parameter was set. | 

## Example

```python
from deadlock_api_client.models.lane_soul_curve import LaneSoulCurve

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LaneSoulCurve from a JSON string
lane_soul_curve_instance = LaneSoulCurve.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(LaneSoulCurve.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
lane_soul_curve_dict = lane_soul_curve_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LaneSoulCurve from a dict
lane_soul_curve_from_dict = LaneSoulCurve.from_dict(lane_soul_curve_dict)
