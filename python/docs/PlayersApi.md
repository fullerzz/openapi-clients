# **match_history**

Match History


This endpoint returns the player match history for the given `account_id`.

If the account is friends with one of our bots, the match history is a combination of the data from **Steam** and **ClickHouse**, so you always get the most up-to-date data and full history.
If the account is not friends with a bot, only the stored match history from **ClickHouse** is returned.

# **rank**
> RankResponse rank(account_id)

Rank


Returns the player's rank at the end of their latest ranked match, i.e. the rank they entered that
match with plus the progress the match awarded. A subrank spans 1000 progress points, so a single
match can move the badge. Eternus subranks are instead percentile cuts Valve recomputes daily, so
within Eternus the badge is the one the player entered the match with.

Only ranked matches carry a rank, and it stays unset while the player is in placement games.
When none of the player's recent ranked matches reports a rank, `badge`, `rank` and `subrank` are
all `0`, which is the `Obscurus` (unranked) tier, and `last_match` is `null`.

`last_match` carries the rank metadata Valve reported on that match, e.g. rank progress, remaining
placement games and demotion protection.


### Example


```python
import deadlock_api_client
from deadlock_api_client.models.rank_response import RankResponse
from deadlock_api_client.rest import ApiException

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.deadlock-api.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = deadlock_api_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.deadlock-api.com"

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with deadlock_api_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = deadlock_api_client.PlayersApi(api_client)
    account_id = 56 # int | The players `SteamID3`

    try:
        # Rank
        api_response = api_instance.rank(account_id)
        print("The response of PlayersApi->rank:\n")

# **rank_avg_image**
> List[int] rank_avg_image(account_ids, format=format)

Rank Avg Image

Returns the average rank badge image (binary) for a comma-separated list of account IDs. Accounts without a rank are left out of the average; if none of them has one, the `Obscurus` image is returned. Use `?format=webp` for WebP.

### Example


```python
import deadlock_api_client
from deadlock_api_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.deadlock-api.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = deadlock_api_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.deadlock-api.com"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with deadlock_api_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = deadlock_api_client.PlayersApi(api_client)
    account_ids = [56] # List[int] | Comma-separated list of account IDs (max 12).
    format = 'format_example' # str | Image format. Defaults to `png`. Supported: `png`, `webp`. (optional)

    try:
        # Rank Avg Image
        api_response = api_instance.rank_avg_image(account_ids, format=format)
        print("The response of PlayersApi->rank_avg_image:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:

# **rank_image**
> List[int] rank_image(account_id, format=format)

Rank Image

Returns the rank badge image directly (binary), not a URL, with the player's I-VI division numeral drawn on it. Players whose recent ranked matches carry no rank, and players still in placement, get the plain tier badge. Use `?format=webp` for WebP.

import deadlock_api_client
from deadlock_api_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.deadlock-api.com

    format = 'format_example' # str | Image format. Defaults to `png`. Supported: `png`, `webp`. (optional)

    try:
        # Rank Image
        api_response = api_instance.rank_image(account_id, format=format)
