Badge Distribution

 This endpoint returns the player badge distribution.  `total_matches` counts matches by their average badge, while `unique_players` counts players by the rank Valve reported at the end of their latest ranked match within the filtered range. Since only ranked matches carry a rank, `unique_players` ignores the `match_mode` filter and always looks at ranked matches.  Ranks exist only from the first ranked season on, so `min_unix_timestamp` is clamped to its start.  ### Rate Limits: > The rate limits below are **shared across all analytics endpoints**.  | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 200req/min | | Key | 400req/min | | Global | 2000req/min |

## item_flow_stats

> models::ItemFlowStats item_flow_stats(phase_interval_s, phase_count, game_mode, match_mode, hero_ids, min_unix_timestamp, max_unix_timestamp, min_duration_s, max_duration_s, min_networth, max_networth, min_average_badge, max_average_badge, min_match_id, max_match_id, min_matches, account_ids, include_item_ids, exclude_item_ids, locked_item_ids, locked_columns)
Item Flow Stats

 Retrieves item build-flow statistics: per-phase item win/pick rates and the transitions between them.  Items are grouped into columns by the in-match phase they were bought in (controlled by `phase_interval_s` and `phase_count`). The response contains `nodes` (items aggregated within a phase) and `edges` (transitions between an item and items in the next phase). A locked build path can be supplied via `locked_item_ids` / `locked_columns` to restrict the population to players who bought those items in the given stage columns.  Each node also carries `adjusted_win_rate`: the item's win rate standardized to the stage's net-worth-at-buy distribution. Because players who are already ahead have more souls and buy items sooner, raw win rate is heavily confounded by wealth; the adjusted figure re-weights each item's win rate across net-worth buckets to the stage-wide distribution, isolating the item's contribution from the buyer's lead. It is still observational, not a controlled/causal estimate. `reached_per_column` gives the distinct baseline games that bought any upgrade in each column, so consumers can show how survivorship-selected (e.g. long-game-only) a late stage is.  Results are cached for **1 hour** based on the unique combination of query parameters provided.  ### Rate Limits: > The rate limits below are **shared across all analytics endpoints**.  | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 200req/min | | Key | 400req/min | | Global | 2000req/min |

## lane_matchup_stats

> Vec<models::LaneMatchupStats> lane_matchup_stats(game_mode, match_mode, min_unix_timestamp, max_unix_timestamp, min_duration_s, max_duration_s, min_average_badge, max_average_badge, min_match_id, max_match_id, sample_time_s, assigned_lanes, hero_ids, enemy_hero_ids, stats, group_by, min_matches, max_matches, account_ids)
Lane Matchup Stats (Subject to Change)

 > **⚠️ Subject to change:** This endpoint is newly added and not yet stable. Its parameters, response fields and semantics may change or be removed without notice.  Retrieves duo-versus-duo lane statistics: how a pair of heroes sharing a lane performed against the pair of heroes they laned against.  Win rate covers the whole match. Everything else is read at `sample_time_s` (900 by default, the last sample before the game's recording cadence coarsens) off the matchups that lasted that long, counted by `sample_matches`. Souls are always reported, in `net_worth_diff`; pass `stats` for any other per-tick stat the game records — kills, denies, player damage, healing, level and so on — each as the duo's own combined value *and* as its lead over the enemy duo.  Only lanes where *both* sides fielded exactly two players are counted, and each lane contributes one row per side, so every matchup appears twice with the two sides swapped.  `group_by` chooses what a row stands for. The default groups all three dimensions, giving one row per duo-versus-duo matchup per lane. Dropping `enemy_hero_ids` gives a duo's record across every opponent, dropping `hero_ids` gives what a duo is up against, and dropping `assigned_lane` merges the lanes. Folded dimensions come back as `0` / an empty array.  Pass `hero_ids` and `enemy_hero_ids` to scope the response to the duos you care about. Without them the full duo-versus-duo matrix is computed, which is a considerably more expensive query.  Results are cached for **1 hour**. The cache key is determined by the specific combination of filter parameters used in the query. Subsequent requests using the exact same filters within this timeframe will receive the cached response.  ### Rate Limits: > The rate limits below are **shared across all analytics endpoints**.  | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 200req/min | | Key | 400req/min | | Global | 2000req/min |

**sample_time_s** | Option<**u32**> | Seconds into the match the stat readings are taken at. **Default:** 900. Matchups whose match ended earlier are still counted in `wins` and `matches_played`, but contribute no reading; `sample_matches` reports how many did. |  |[default to 900]

Lane Soul Curve (Subject to Change)

 > **⚠️ Subject to change:** This endpoint is newly added and not yet stable. Its parameters, response fields and semantics may change or be removed without notice.  Retrieves how a duo's lead over the duo they laned against develops over the course of the match.  The curve is not interpolated: it carries exactly the samples the game records, which are every 180 seconds up to the 15 minute mark and every 300 seconds after that. It runs from `min_time_s` (180 by default) to `max_time_s`, which is open by default, so a matchup is followed until its matches end. `sample_matches` reports how many matchups were still running at each point, and thins out towards the end of the curve.  Only lanes where *both* sides fielded exactly two players are counted, and each lane contributes one row per side, so every matchup appears twice with the two sides swapped.  Souls are always reported, in `net_worth_diff`. Pass `stats` for curves of any other per-tick stat the game records — kills, denies, player damage, healing, level and so on — each as the duo's own combined value *and* as its lead over the enemy duo.  `group_by` chooses what a row stands for. The default groups all three dimensions, giving one row per duo-versus-duo matchup per lane. Dropping `enemy_hero_ids` gives a duo's curve across every opponent, dropping `hero_ids` gives what a duo is up against, and dropping `assigned_lane` merges the lanes. Folded dimensions come back as `0` / an empty array.  Pass `hero_ids` and `enemy_hero_ids` to scope the response to the duos you care about.

Player Stats Metrics

 Returns comprehensive statistical analysis of player performance.  Results are cached for **1 hour** based on the unique combination of query parameters provided. Subsequent identical requests within this timeframe will receive the cached response.  > Note: Quantiles are calculated using the [DDSketch](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2195-masson.pdf) algorithm, so they are not exact but have a maximum relative error of 0.01.  ### Rate Limits: > The rate limits below are **shared across all analytics endpoints**.  | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 200req/min | | Key | 400req/min | | Global | 2000req/min |
